                <p>
                  Recently, at <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/">Holberton School</a>, we were assigned with a
                  project where we create our own simple shell program with a partner in our cohort.
                  The goal of it is to learn all about all the inner workings of a shell.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>File System Tree:</h4>
                This is where files are organized into a hierarchical directory structure,
                and each directory contains its own files. The system tree when displayed in the
                terminal is separated by a forward slash “/”. The first directory is the highest
                directory in that system tree. Each directory to the right, divided by each forward
                slash, indicates the next directory in the hierarchy on the level below the previous.
                When the user searches for content, files or directories, this shows the order or path
                that is taken when the system searches for the file or directory. It looks just like a tree!
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>What is a Shell?</h4>
                It is, in all its essence, the command line interface (CLI). Its interface basically reads a command
                like <b>cd</b> (change directory) then passes it to the operating system to carry out.
                Now you understand the inner workings of the file system on your computer, but without the Shell,
                a typical user would see a file system on their computer as icons of folders that have titles, and
                then once clicked, contain files that are held. Here is what it looks like from a Windows computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>Working with ‘LS’</h4>
                <b>ls</b> is a shell command built-in just like <b>cd</b>, which will list your files and directories
                from your current
                working directory. The <b>ls</b> command is a quite common command that is used when needing to view all
                files.
                The <b>ls</b> command automatically sorts the files in the directory in alphabetical order if there are
                no sort
                flags given on the command line. The contents that are displayed in the terminal using this command can
                show with different colors. Content titles that are regular files will display in the color of white.
                Content titles that are directories will display in the color of blue. Content titles that are
                executable
                files will display in the color of green. Content titles that are symbolic links will display in the
                lighter
                color of sky blue. Content titles that are image files will display in the color of magenta. Content
                titles
                that are archived files will display in the color of red. The <b>ls</b> command can be used in
                conjunction with flags
                to give you more information on the contents in that current directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <b>-l</b> option can be passed alongside it in some instances. What this option does is format the
                  output
                  this time, in a long list. When contents are displayed using the <b>-l</b> option, it gives detailed
                  information that is
                  attributed to the content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another difference you may have noticed here is that the list now contains new pieces of code that
                  display
                  permissions such as: read, write, execute for different users, owner of the file, size in bytes, and
                  the date
                  of the last time you modified anything in your existing repositories.
                </p>
                The <b>ls -l</b> combination can not only be used for the current working directory, but you can also
                use it to display contents of other directories. If
                you use the format <b>ls -l /pathname</b>, it will display the detailed information. The “–” symbol is
                used
                to let
                the system know that it would be looking for regular files. The first section of each file will
                contain a
                possible combination of <b>{“-”, r, w and x}</b>. The first group of combinations are permissions given
                to
                the user,
                the next group is permissions given to the group & the last group gives permissions to others. The
                <b>r</b>
                represents that
                the file has the assigned group and has the proper permissions to be able to read the file. The <b>w</b>
                represents that the
                file has the assigned group has the proper permissions to be able to write to the file. The <b>x</b>
                represents that the file
                has the assigned group and has the proper permissions to be able to execute the file.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The number immediately after this counts the number of links if the content is a file. If the content
                  is
                  a directory, it adds the sub-nodes to the count. The name that displays in the next section to the
                  right
                  would be the owner of the file. Continuing to the right this information displays which group the file
                  belongs
                  to. The next section lets you know how big the file is in bytes. After the size is date section that
                  displays
                  the information about the last modified or creation date as well as the time the change or creation
                  occurred.
                  The last section on the line displays the filename.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now… in order to add the <b>*.c</b> option we will need to open a repository or directory because this
                  will list
                  specifically all of our .c files that can be compiled using the GCC compiler and inevitably return
                  back to
                  us an object file that is a raw executable. Once the files are compiled into an executable file you
                  can run
                  the file in the terminal by using the syntax <b>./filename</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>What REALLY Goes Into It?</h4>
                <p>
                  There are a series of steps that go into play when a user types a command into the Shell.
                  Those steps are: Parsing, Checking for Aliases, Checking for Built-In’s, and Execution.
                </p>
                <h5>Step One:</h5>
                Parsing is is the process of analyzing a string of symbols. In order to configure the user
                input, a function called <b>strtok()</b>, then begins to parse the command into tokens. When using
                the strtok function it uses the parameters of the string that needs to be parsed and well
                as a delimiter. The delimiter lets the system know where to end each token. Some of the common
                delimiters are: /, : , etc. Now, <b>ls -l</b> will tokenize into an array of strings containing [“ls”,
                “-l”].
                Each token will be evaluated individually.
                </p>
                <h5>Step Two:</h5>
                <p>
                  The Shell will then check if any of the commands are either a built-in or an alias. If any of the
                  tokens
                  are an alias, they are converted. If the token is a built-in, the shell can run the command given at
                  the
                  first index position of the array.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>What is an Alias?</em>
                <p>
                  It is essentially a shortcut for a command. It can be used to be more efficient and avoid typing long
                  commands. They are typically stored in a file like, .bashrc. There are two different types of aliases
                  that can be created, a temporary or a permanent. An alias can be created on the command line in the
                  terminal.
                  In order to create an alias, you would type alias followed by a space and the name that you would like
                  to give
                  your alias. Following the name, you would type in “=” and quotation marks. In between the quotation
                  marks you
                  would type the command that you want to run when you use the newly created alias. This will create a
                  temporary
                  alias that can be used during your current terminal session.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to make your alias a permanent alias, you would have to save in one of the config profile
                  files.
                  The available shell configuration profile files would be bash (~/.bashrc), ZSH (~/.zshrc) or Fish
                  (~/.config/fish/config.fish).
                  Sometimes it is necessary to delete your permanent alias and the process can be done one of 2 ways.
                  The first way
                  is to type in the terminal line unalias followed by the alias name. This removes a single alias from
                  the system.
                  You can also go into the shell configuration profile file that you saved the alias in. Delete the line
                  that contains
                  the alias that you no longer need, save the file and close it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>What is a Built-in?</em>
                <p>
                  These are commands, moreover “functions” that are a part of the Shell. The function would run and pass
                  all its arguments, then return back again for the next input (this would be done in a file containing
                  a do-while loop).
                </p>
                <p>
                <h6>Fun Fact:</h6> Entering <b>type</b> and then a command will let you know if it is either an alias or
                a
                built-in function.
                </p>
                <h5>Step Three:</h5>
                <p>
                  The command will be compared to the PATH. This is an environment variable that specifies a set of
                  directories that contain executable programs.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p class="mb-0">“The /bin, /usr/bin, and /usr/local/bin directories are typically included in most
                    users’ $PATH” -Wikipedia
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The directories contain all the commands a user can enter. The <b>fork()</b> function (also a system
                  call)
                  creates a child process that duplicates the environment straight from the parent process, and begins
                  to run then eventually close itself, and return back to the parent process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The command can now be executed using <b>execve()</b> function and we should receive our expected
                  output,
                  listing all files and directories in long format!! As you can see, The Shell undergoes a lot of
                  analyzation
                  before we receive what we are looking for. It’s not so simple after all. Thanks for reading along.
                </p>
